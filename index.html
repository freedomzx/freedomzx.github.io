        <h1>Personal</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Elijah Ongoco, and I am a student of Rutgers University.  I enjoy playing video games, learning new things related to computer science, and eating good food.<br>
          Although not the biggest Marvel fan, my favorite movie is Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.  My favorite song is Viva la Vida by Coldplay.<br>
          Finally, my favorite video game is NieR:Automata.  (all of my favorites have/are great songs!)
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the projects that I am working on are: this website, and learning how to make an app using JavaScript's React library.

        <h1>Education</h1>
        <h2> About </h2>
        <p> Currently, I am a senior at Rutgers University who is pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Cognitive Science.  <br>
        I learning how to utilize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my free time, which is the reason this website came to be.  <br>
        In addition, I am looking for ways to apply my knowledge and experience in C, Java, and Python to software development.
        </p>
        <h2> Courses Taken</h2>
        <p> I've taken a varied selection of Computer Science classes, covering a broad range of topics. <br><br>
        The highlights of my academic career thus far have been Systems Programming, Principles of Info and Data Management, and Operating Systems. <br>
        In Systems Programming, I experienced an introduction on the programming of system software.  There were a few topics I found particularly interesting, such as multithreading and sockets. <br>
        In Principles of Info and Data Management, I learned how to create relational models that give insight on the workings of databases.<br>  This translated later into understanding of how to query and create relational databases, such as SQL. <br>
        In Operating Systems, I learned the components of an operating system, and have even implemented some of them (multithreading library, memory management library, memory virtualization and segmentation library)<br> in projects for the course.  <br><br>
        <br>
        The complete list of CS-related classes that I have taken are as follows: Introduction to Computer Science, Data Structures, Discrete Mathematics/Structures 1+2, Computer Architecture, Systems Programming, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Operating System Design, Principles of Info & Data Management (Databases), Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Network Technology, Introduction to Data Science, and Network Security.
