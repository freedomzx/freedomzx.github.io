        <p>
          My name is Elijah Ongoco, and I am a student of Rutgers University.  I enjoy playing video games, learning new things related to computer science, and eating good food.<br>
          Although not the biggest Marvel fan, my favorite movie is Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.  My favorite song is Viva la Vida by Coldplay.<br>
          Finally, my favorite video game is NieR:Automata.  (all of my favorites have/are great songs!)
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the projects that I am working on are: this website, and learning how to make an app using JavaScript's React library.

        <h1>Education</h1>
        <h2> About </h2>
        <p> Currently, I am a junior at Rutgers University who is pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Cognitive Science.  <br>
        I am currently learning how to utilize the HTML/CSS/JavaScript trio, which is the reason this website came to be.  <br>
        In addition, I am looking for ways to apply my knowledge and experience in C, Java, and Python to software development.
        </p>
        <h2> Courses Taken</h2>
        <p> So far, I've elected to take classes that pertain more to the systems side of being a computer scientist. <br><br>
        The highlights of my academic career thus far have been Systems Programming, Principles of Info and Data Management, and Operating Systems. <br>
        In Systems Programming, I experienced an introduction on the programming of system software.  There were a few topics I found particularly interesting, such as multithreading and sockets. <br>
        In Principles of Info and Data Management, I learned how to create relational models that give insight on the workings of databases.  This translated later into understanding of how to query and create relational databases, such as SQL. <br>
        In Operating Systems, I learned the components of an operating system, and have even implemented some of them (multithreading library, memory management library) in projects for the course.  <br><br>

        These are the classes that I've found to be the most interesting so far, but there have also been very useful ones such as Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis that will always be helpful for me in the future.<br><br>
        In future semesters, I want to take classes such as Cybersecurity, Software Engineering/Methodology, Network Analysis, and Introduction to AI.  These are classes I find conceptually interesting, and hope to be able to apply the knowledge I gain from them into my future careers.
        <br><br>
        The complete list of CS-related classes that I have taken are as follows: Introduction to Computer Science, Data Structures, Discrete Mathematics/Structures 1+2, Computer Architecture, Systems Programming, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Operating System Design, and Principles of Info & Data Management (Databases).
